# NASA Pale Blue Dot Project

## Overview

Welcome to the NASA Pale Blue Dot Project! This project aims to address critical challenges related to Clean Water and Sanitation as well as Climate Action. We leverage satellite and remote sensing data provided by NASA and other open source organisations to analyze, visualize, and contribute insights to these global challenges.

## 1. Challenges

### 1.1 Clean Water and Sanitation

In the context of **Clean Water and Sanitation**, we focus on leveraging satellite data to monitor water resources, detect water pollution, and assess the impact on aquatic ecosystems. Our goal is to contribute to initiatives that ensure access to clean and safe water for all.

### 1.2 Climate Action

For **Climate Action**, our efforts involve analyzing climate patterns, monitoring changes in land use, and studying environmental phenomena. By utilizing NASA's extensive satellite imagery, we aim to contribute valuable insights into climate change and support actions that mitigate its effects.

## 2. Folders and Files 
* visuals: Output Visualizations country wise folders
* src: codes on Jupyter notebook `src folders` before download required packages in `requirements.ipynb` and `requirements.py` for extra data downloading.
* raw datas: official Planetary Computer `json files(api_key)` for Virtualizations 

## 3. Repository Structure

- `data`: Contains datasets used for analysis, including satellite imagery and climate data.
- `analysis`: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for data analysis and visualization.
- `results`: Visualizations, findings, video outputs and reports generated from the analysis.

## 4. Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/NASA-Pale-Blue-Dot-Project.git
cd NASA-Pale-Blue-Dot-Project
```
2) Explore the analysis directory for Jupyter notebooks and scripts.

3) Contribute by submitting issues, pull requests, or enhancing the analysis.

## 5. Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the community. If you're passionate about Clean Water and Sanitation or Climate Action, feel free to contribute by:

- Adding new analysis scripts or notebooks.
- Improving existing code for better efficiency.
- Enhancing visualizations and insights.
- Reporting issues or suggesting improvements.
